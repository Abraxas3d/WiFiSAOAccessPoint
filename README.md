# WiFiSAOAccessPoint

This is a sketch designed to work with HackerBox 0068, turning the wifi enabled SAO badge add on into an access point.

Note: Apparently some mobile devices, at least Android devices, have trouble accessing a local (no-internet) wifi network like this produces while they are also connected to the wireless carriers.  This is a client side problem.
